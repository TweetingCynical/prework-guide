          <ul>
          <li>Use the HEAD element to hold information for the browser and search engines.</li>
          <li>Use the BODY element for what your users will see.</li>
          <li>Use ul or ol for lists and identify each point using the li element.</li>
          <li>Inside the bounds of img, you can include the source using src="http..." and its width and height.</li>
          <li>Use br for a whole line break.</li>

          <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Use BOX model for all elements (Content, padding, border, margin.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Add formatting information for each element type contained on your index page.</li>
          <li>Use DRY to avoid repeating or duplicating. h1, h2 { } is an example of how to combine.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
          <li>console.log(myVariableName) prints the current value (at the point this line of code is executed) to the console</li>
          <li>console.log("Let's study HTML!") prints the text inside the quote marks</li>
          <li>Control flow is important as JS works from top to bottom, but evaluates the entirity of for loops before moving on</li>
          <li>if (condition) {
            // block of code to be executed if condition is truthy
           }</li>
           <li>Falsey: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean of false</li>
           <li>Once JS has found a step inside an if statement that IS truthy, it runs that code, and then breaks out of the if. This means NO CODE after a truthy statement, will run inside the IF</li>
           <li>if (condition === "ThisIS CASE sensitiVE") It has to be an eact match.</li>
           <li>var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; saves values in an array and refers to them as shapes[0], shapes[1] etc.</li>
           <li>Arrays can hold different data types! SOOOO USEFUL!</li>
           <li>var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
            console.log(shapes[0]);
            for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                console.log(shapes[x]);
               }</li>
            <li>The for loop consists of the for statement, then 3 conditional parts inside the brackets, then the action to take for each step while the x value inside the for loop is less than the number of array items</li>
